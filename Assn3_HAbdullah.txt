Square Inc.									          Hanny Abdullah

Square is a software company which creates hardware solutions as well as the software that goes with it to enable companies to perform transactions between business and customer. They also provide financing solutions to small businesses and have a share in the restaurant ordering market. They are also the creators of the Cash App. 

To pursue a career as a software engineer at Square there are many frameworks and languages that I would need to better understand and practice with.  The first step of my plan would be to understand the concept of square more. As well as reading up on the company, there are many coffee shops and bodegas which use Square devices to perform transactions.

 Square uses many different languages and frameworks to further their software. I would begin by practicing the Java language more. Through my practice, I would begin to play with the Ember framework to get a better familiarity with it. Most software engineer job postings at Square indicate that they rely on prospective employees having a very good understanding of the Ember framework. One skill I lack experience with the Ruby language. I would begin to take introductory courses online about the Ruby language to familiarize myself with it. Square uses the Ruby on Rails framework so once I have a basic understanding of the syntax of Ruby, I would begin to learn Ruby on Rails.  Square also uses a query language for APIÃ•s which is known as GraphQL. I am not familiar with this query language and would have to begin to study it and familiarize myself with it.  

Some skills I do believe that I possess to attain a career with Square is that I can work well with large groups and with individuals within the company. I have strong communication skills and would be able to get along with people within the company. I also like to make sure any code I write is well documented and is formatting consistently throughout.
